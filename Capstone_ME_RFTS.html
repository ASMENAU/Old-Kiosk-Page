Abstract: <br />
<p3>The requirement of this project is to divert a missile or flying object by creating an unstable aerodynamic response to land the object within a specified footprint. The footprint for which the missile of vehicle must land within will be a function of the speed, the overall size, and the mass of the object. We also must provide this calculated footprint to Raytheon at the end of the project. We are also supposed to design the door to be scalable so that it can be used on any size object that would require such a termination to occur.  The speeds that the drag door will operate between are sub-sonic up to Mach 2. The door itself must be made of a feasible EAM that has already been created and is easily accessible.</p3>

<div class="CapstoneDetails">
Final Design: <br />
<p3>After selecting our EAM we created a design that would integrate the material. For the Aluminum Honeycomb we created a two piece housing that would crush the material when an axial wind load was applied. This box only moves in one direction to maximize the amount of energy absorbed by the honeycomb. The actual door section was created from 6061-T4 Aluminum so that material continuity was kept between the missile skin and the outer part of our door. The hinge system is all made out of 304 Stainless steel because it is the lightest material that can support the forces on the door.</p3>
