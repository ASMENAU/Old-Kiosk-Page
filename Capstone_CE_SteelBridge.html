Abstract: <br />
<p3>
Every year the NAU student chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) takes part in the steel bridge competition at the Pacific Southwest Regional Conference (PSWRC). This year's steel bridge team will be competing at the PSWRC in Pomona, California on March 22nd - March 24th. The steel bridge will be judged based on its aesthetics, construction economy, weight, and stiffness. The team has designed the bridge to conform to the ASCE/AISCE 2012 rules for the steel bridge competition. Rules for the competition include dimensional, weight, and material restrictions. To determine the stiffness of the bridge it will be loaded at the competition. Additionally, the team will be timed on how quickly they can assemble the bridge.

Competition Details: <br />
<p3>
This year's scenario for the bridge states that Broken Paddle Resort, Inc. has expressed interest in building a bridge to permit vehicular access to a proposed lodge. The passageway bridge will be constructed over a fast moving river that is popular with local rafters and kayakers. The Broken Paddle construction manager (CM) has requested design/build proposals for the new bridge. In addition, the CM also requires the submittal of a 1:10 scale model capable of demonstrating the full-scale bridge properties. </p3>
