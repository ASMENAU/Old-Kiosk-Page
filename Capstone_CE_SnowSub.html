Abstract: <br />
<p3>
The purpose of this study is to examine how Ponderosa pine forest canopy density affects the loss of snow by sublimation. The first objective was  realized by mapping the time history of snow loss, from an instrument, which mimics a Ponderosa pine bough, against the following climate factors: temperature, relative humidity, snow surface-area and wind velocity.  The second objective was realized by extracting snow cores from the forest floor snowpack under four different forest canopy densities on a daily basis until the snowpack was  completely depleted.  The following forest canopy densities were examined: Alpine Meadow (0%),  Recently thinned (15-30%), Mature thinned (30-45%), Untreated (45-60%). It was  found the rate of snow loss on the forest floor increases as canopy density decreases.

<p3>
Using the SWE data, Snowpack Engineering will gain a better understanding for how the four different forest densities retain snow over time. Additionally, experimental observations will be collected that examine the effect of wind, temperature, humidity and exposed snow surface area on the rate of snow loss due to sublimation. The rate of snow sublimation when snow is intercepted by the forest canopy will be compared to the rate of sublimation when snow reaches the forest floor.
