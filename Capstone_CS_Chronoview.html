Problem Statement: <br />
<p3>
Chronoview is timeline creation software designed to meet the needs of students and educators. Chronoview was created to solve the problems plaguing existing timeline creation software including cluttered interfaces, abundance of impractical features, and lack of collaboration tools. Chronoview addresses these problems by providing a simplistic interface and powerful toolset to facilitate the creation of timelines. Chronoview was implemented as a web-based application, allowing users to store their created timelines online and edit them directly within their browser. Users can upload existing timeline data or create timelines from scratch, embed their created timelines within a webpage, export them to various image formats, or allow their peers permission to edit them.

<div class="CapstoneDetails">
Benefits: <br />
<p3> 
By developing a web application that can store events in a centralized database, create then save timelines based on those events, all at the same time creating a user friendly web interface to create, edit and share timelines and events with others. This will facilitate and create a community based solely on historical data and a well organized way of displaying that data to teach others about our past.
