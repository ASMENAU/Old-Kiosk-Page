Abstract: <br />
<p3>
Increased oil prices and the need to curb pollution have spawned a renewed interest in electric vehicles. One application somewhat overlooked in electric vehicle design is the industrial sector. To address this we designed an electric motor controller to meet the rigors of heavy duty high power usage. This design application prompted a set of problems that, although not unique to motor controllers, were intensified in our application. An example of this was the greater amount of heat produced by our design, requiring careful temperature monitoring. We also incorporated power monitoring sensors in our design to ensure a stable system. The end result is a device that can operate with power loads of up to 250,000 watts. Compared to the 40,000 watt to 60,000 watt range currently available.

Background: <br />
<p3>
Electric powered vehicles, also known as EVs are not a new concept. In fact, they have been around for at least 100 years in some form or another. Interestingly in the last 5 or so years EV technology has improved drastically enough that the field is rapidly regaining consumer attention. With a renewed interest in EVs, new uses for them are being discovered. New applications often require unique technologies and our case is no exception.
