Problem Statement: <br />
<p3>
The purpose of this project is to redesign East Verde Lakes Drive located in Camp Verde, AZ. The roadway intersects the West Clear Creek stream. A redesign of the roadway is required because the roadway is over-topped 15-20 times a year by the creek due to unsubstantial culvert systems. As per client request, the redesign will allow over-topping once or twice a year. To complete the design the following tasks were established: hydrology, hydraulic analysis, alternative analysis, culvert design, and roadway design. Hydrology includes determining a design flow by analyzing data from an upstream flow gauge station. A design flow of 1,500 cfs was chosen. A hydraulic analysis was then performed to determine the size and shape of the channel. The design flow and channel properties were used to calculate velocity and depth of flow used to determine culvert size, type, and placement. Finally, the new roadway was designed.

Technical Challenges: <br />
<p3> 
Technical challenges the design team will face include the length of the roadway, culvert placement, and regulatory issues. Because this roadway is 800 feet long, multiple culverts will need to be implemented; they may be different types of culverts depending on the type of flow at each location. Culvert placement will be established by determining the critical points at which the stream crosses the roadway. Finally, this stream falls under section 404 of the Clean Water Act which prohibits interference with the streams current path as well as adding pollutants (fill) to the stream. In addition, if the road must be raised vertically, it will require wider fore slopes, thus creating a potential challenge for the team's vertical alignment design.
