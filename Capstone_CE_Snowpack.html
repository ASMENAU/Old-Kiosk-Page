Abstract: <br />
<p3>Snowpack modeling has become an essential component in forecasting snowmelt runoff. In this project our team will use a model that was developed to determine the total storage capacity of a drainage basin from a remote location. This model was developed in 2010 by Sam Heffelfinger, and Kevin Werbylo, NAU students. Currently, the model is difficult to operate and requires extensive knowledge about the program. The purpose of this project is to simplify the previously developed model to allow large companies to use it as a first approximation of the expected runoff from snowpack storage.</p3>

Background: <br />
<p3>Examining Snow Water Equivalency (SWE) is a large consideration for many different scenarios in where to build new communities and where the new communities will get their water. In determining if a new community can use a drainage basin as its source for water certain questions must be answered before money will be invested. The existing program developed by Sam Heffelfinger and Kevin Werbylo attempts to answer one of the larger questions, which is how much water, is stored in the basin of interest.
