Abstract: <br />
<p3>Renewable energy is a rapidly growing sector of the energy market in today�s modern world. Current small scale renewable energy systems offer advantages to the environment, as well as disadvantages, such as location restrictions and constant power output. Large scale operations currently only produce a small amount of the total energy used in the United States [1].

An energy solution is needed that can overcome the challenges of location and costs, as well as offer reliability and a constant, uninterrupted power supply. Cold temperature geothermal energy production, operating at temperatures of 60� to 75� Fahrenheit, is a solution to these problems.

Background: <br />
<p3>
The overall power consumption in the United States in 2010 was approximately 2.9 x 1013 kilowatt-hours (kWh) [1]. Of that power, 83 percent was produced by fossil fuels, coal and natural gas. 9 percent was produced with nuclear power plants. This overwhelming use of non-renewable, environmentally unfriendly energy sources has created environmental impacts that will resonate, not only in the near future, but for centuries to come.</p3>
