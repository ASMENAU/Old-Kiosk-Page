Abstract: <br />
<p3>
Development of electric vehicles is essential to reducing pollutants and additionally beneficial to reducing transportation costs. Part of the Shell Eco-Marathon was to design the electric systems of such a vehicle, and our goal was to optimize efficiency of the vehicle's battery usage. To achieve this we programmed a motor control system to improve acceleration efficiency for the SAE-NAU urban concept vehicle. All  components were chosen to work together in order to optimize efficiency and reliability based on statistical data gathered about the motor, potentially increasing battery life up to several hours in an urban driving environment.  Making electric vehicles more efficient is a key improvement to the world's economy and environment.

Competition Details: <br />
<p3>
The Shell Eco-marathon is a challenge held every year that involves student teams to design, build, and test vehicles that are energy efficient. Vehicles built are designed to a set of rules and compete against each other to see which vehicle is most efficient. The vehicle this year will be competing in the Urban Concept category under the section of a battery electric vehicle.
