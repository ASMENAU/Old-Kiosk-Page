Problem Statement: <br />
<p3>
The goal of the Warmhouse Beach Hydrological Engineering Project is to mitigate the transport of contaminants via the surface water and subsurface water migration pathways into the surrounding environment. The engineering project work will include a hydrological analysis of the site in order to determine the volume and rate of leachate production by the Warmhouse Beach Dump as well as to determine the amount of runoff that enters the dump from the uncontaminated slopes located adjacent to the dump site. The results of this analysis will be used to design leachate containment structures. In addition, runoff collection and diversion structures will be implemented up gradient from the dump to divert runoff from the uncontaminated slopes adjacent to the dump away from the dump.
</p3>

<div class="CapstoneDetails">
Final Product: <br />
<p3> 
The final product of the Warmhouse Beach Hydrological Engineering Project is a conceptual design of the necessary engineered runoff control/diversion structures to successfully mitigate the transport of contamination from the Warmhouse Beach dump to surface and ground water migration pathways. The final design will consist of leachate collection and containment structures such as engineered slurry walls, cut-off walls, diversion channels, or diversion berms. The design of subsurface leachate pumping wells may be required to extract subsurface leachate for a pump and treatment scheme.
