Abstract: <br />
<p3>
NAU's Capital Assets and Services department has asked for an investigation of safety along the main bike/pedway on campus. Investigations include the evaluation of the condition of markings and signs along the path, along with other potential safety issues that the team finds. A full listing of safety issues found during the investigation will be presented. A complete design will also be presented, based off of the rankings that the team has created as a result of the investigations done on the bike/pedway. The design will include drawings of all the team's recommendations for the area that the design will be created for, as well as a cost proposal and a potential phasing plan to be used if funding is not available to implement the entire design all at once.

Details: <br />
<p3>
The designs that the team will create will vary depending on the improvements that need to be made. All designs will include a detailed plan view of the section of path being improved based on the campus map developed in Task 2.2, with all recommended modifications noted. If new construction (i.e. barrier installation) is required by a design, detailed drawings of the new construction will be provided as a part of the design. Elevation views of important details will also be provided.
