Abstract: <br />
<p3>We are the Steelcase Universal Lectern senior design team. For this project, our team is tasked with designing a lectern for Steelcase, Inc. that could potentially be manufactured and sold. The goal of this project is to design a lectern that provides improved access and usability to people with and without disabilities. In order to provide this level of accessibility, our team will be applying principles of universal design, and also complying with 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design.

<div class="CapstoneDetails">
Project Background: <br />
<p3>The Steelcase Inc. universal design lectern became a capstone project when an NAU professor had difficulties accessing certain features of the current teaching lecterns available in the NAU engineering building. The professor informed NAU Facilities about his problem and they were unable to find a lectern on the market that could provide accessibility to the instructor in a way that would work with the current infrastructure. Available lecterns are not designed using universal design techniques and therefore are often not accessible to all people. </p3>
